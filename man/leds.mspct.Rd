\title{Spectral irradiance for diverse LEDs}
\format{
A \code{"source_mspct"} object containing 74 
  \code{"source_spct"} objects.

In each of the member spectra, the variables are as follows:
\itemize{
  \item w.length (nm)  
  \item s.e.irrad (W m-2 nm-1)
}

An object of class \code{source_mspct} (inherits from \code{generic_mspct}, \code{list}) with 3 rows and 1 columns.

\description{
A collection of emission spectra of light-emitting-diodes
  from different suppliers.
}
\details{
The \code{leds.mspct} and \code{led_arrays.mspct} objects contain
  \code{"source_spct"} objects with spectral irradiance data, for single
  channel and multichannel LEDs, respectively. As the exact distance from LED
  to cosine diffuser and/or the driving current vary among spectra, they have
  been all normalized to the wavelength of maximum spectral energy
  irradiance. When the details of the measurement conditions are know, these
  are stored as metadata attributes. In any case, it needs to be taken into
  account than even in these cases measurements have not been done in an
  optical bench, so values of spectral irradiance are subject to errors due
  to possible misalignment. The shape of the spectra, in contrast can be
  relied upon as measurements were done with well calibrated instruments.
  
  The output of LEDs at a given current decreases as their temperature
  increases. The wavelength at the peak of emission can depend on the
  temperature and current, but shifts tend to be only a couple of nanometres.
  In LED arrays with heterogeneous LED chips or white LEDs based on secondary
  emission from phosphor the shape of the spectrum can slightly change
  depending on the drive current and temperature.
  
  There is variation among LEDs of the same type, specially with respect
  wavelength and light output. The data included are for individual LEDs and
  can be expected to differ to some extent from the typical values in the
  manufacturers specifications. Some of the LEDs for which data are included
  are only of historical interest as their production has been discontinued,
  usually replaced by new types with enhanced performance. When known, the
  approximate "vintage" is provided in the metadata.
  
  Some LEDs are "generic" ones which lacked detailed data sheets at the time
  of purchase, or even lacked a manufacturer's type denomination code. For
  them, the metadata is necessarily less detailed.
  
  The spectral data are not expressed at constant wavelength intervals. Not
  only the intervals vary in the raw data from the array spectrometer, but in
  addition function \code{\link[photobiology]{thin_wl}} has been applied to
  reduce the storage space needed. In brief the wavelength interval has been
  increased as much as possible in those regions of the spectrum that lack
  detailed features (such as linear slopes and wavelength regions with zero
  light emission). The algorithm used preserved the location and height of 
  significant energy emission peaks, i.e., the global peak and clear local 
  peaks.
