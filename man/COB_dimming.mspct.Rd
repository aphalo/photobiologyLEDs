\title{Constant-current dimming of LEDs}
\format{
A \code{"source_mspct"} object containing 8
  \code{"source_spct"} objects.

In each of the member spectra, the variables are as follows:
\itemize{
  \item w.length (nm)  
  \item s.e.irrad (W m-2 nm-1)
}
}
\usage{
COB_dimming.mspct
}
\description{
A collection of emission spectra of a light-emitting-diode
  driven at different constant current.
}
\details{
The \code{"COB_dimming.mspct"} object contains \code{"source_spct"}
  objects with spectral irradiance data with the same Optisolis COB LED from
  Nichia driven at different values of constant current. Distance from LED to
  cosine diffuser was 159 mm; a reflector was attached to the LED to make the
  light beam narrower. Spectra are not normalized. The position for
  the LED with respect to the entrace optics did not vary among measurements.
  
  The COB LED used is the chip-on-board (COB) Optisolis type 
  NFCWL036B-V3-Rfcb0 from Nichia with CRI > 95. Nominal electrical power of
  10.3 W at nominal current of 270 mA. So, two spectra are for the COB 
  over-driven, which is possible with enough cooling, but not recommended.
  
  The spectral data are not expressed at constant wavelength intervals. Not
  only the intervals vary in the raw data from the array spectrometer, but in
  addition function \code{\link[photobiology]{thin_wl}} has been applied to
  reduce the storage space needed. In brief the wavelength interval has been
  increased as much as possible in those regions of the spectrum that lack
  detailed features (such as linear slopes and wavelength regions with zero
  light emission).
