\title{Spectral emission data for light emitting diodes (LEDs)}
\description{
This package provides data for some commercialy available LEDs. The package is designed
to complement package \code{photobiology}. The LEDs have been measured in total darkness. The LEds
have been bought over several years time period, and some may no longer be available. All data are
from individual pieces, and they do not necesarily represent the typical performance. It is always
best to measure any light source that you have actually used. These data sets are included mainly
for assessing their suitability when planning experiments, or for use in training, as examples
for exercises.
