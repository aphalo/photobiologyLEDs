Package '**photobiologyLEDs**' complements other packages in the [_R for photobiology_ suite](https://www.r4photobiology.info/). It contains spectral emission data for diverse types of light emitting diodes (LEDs) and LED arrays (`leds.mspct`) available as electronic components. Spectra for LED-based lamps and other lamps are included in package ['photobioloyLamps'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiologyLamps/). Package 'photobiologyLEDs' also includes spectra from a COB LED when dimmed using the constant current approach (`COB_dimming.mspct`) and for a COB LED combined with reflectors with different beam angles (`COB_reflectors.mspct`).

This package contains only data. Data are stored as collections of spectra of class `source_mspct` from package 'photobiology', which is the core of the 
[_R for photobiology_ suite](https://www.r4photobiology.info/). Spectra can
be easily plotted with functions and methods from package ['ggspectra'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ggspectra/). The spectra can be used seamlessly with functions from package ['photobioloy'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiology/). However,
class `source_mspct` is derived from `list` and class `source_spct` is derived from `data.frame` making the data also usable as is with base R functions.
 
## Examples

```{r readme-01, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.asp = 2/3,
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "man/figures/README-"
)
```

```{r example-02, message=FALSE}
eval_plots <- requireNamespace("ggspectra", quietly = TRUE)
if (eval_plots) library(ggspectra)
library(photobiologyLEDs)
```

How many spectra are included in the current version of 'photobiologyLEDs'?

```{r example-03}
length(leds.mspct)
```

```{r example-03a}
length(COB_dimming.mspct)
```

```{r example-03d}
length(COB_reflectors.mspct)
```

What are the names of available spectra. We use `head()` to limit the output.

```{r example-04}
# list names of the first 10 LEDs
head(names(leds.mspct), 10)
```

To subset based on different criteria we can use predefined character vectors of LED names. For example, vector `Osram_leds` lists the names of the spectra for LEDs made by Osram. 

```{r example-05}
Osram_leds
```

We can use the vector to extract all these spectra as a collection.

```{r example-05a}
leds.mspct[Osram_leds]
```

The package includes character vectors with the names of LEDs grouped by brand, colors, and uses. These names can be used as indexing vectors to extract one or more spectra from the `leds.mspct` collection.

```{r example-05b}
led_colors
```

```{r example-05c}
led_brands
```

```{r example-05d}
led_uses
```

Vectors like `Osram_leds` shown above are available for all the brands listed in `led_brands`, all the colors in `led_colors`, and all the uses in `led_uses`.

Summary calculations can be easily done with methods from package 'photobiology'. Here we calculate photon irradiance. As the spectra are normalised we pass `allow.scaled = TRUE`, 

```{r example-06}
q_irrad(leds.mspct[["Nichia_NS6L183AT_H1_sw"]], 
        allow.scaled = TRUE, scale.factor = 1e6)
```

The `autoplot()` methods from package 'ggspectra' can be used for plotting one or more spectra at a time.

```{r, eval=eval_plots}
autoplot(leds.mspct[["Nichia_NS6L183AT_H1_sw"]]) + theme_bw()
```

The classes of the objects used to store the spectral data are derived from `"data.frame"` making direct use of the data with functions and methods from base R and various packages easy.

## Documentation 

HTML documentation is available at (https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiologyLEDs/), including a _User Guide_.

News on updates to the different packages of the 'r4photobiology' suite are regularly posted at (https://www.r4photobiology.info/).

Two articles introduce the basic ideas behind the design of the suite and its use:
Aphalo P. J. (2015) (https://doi.org/10.19232/uv4pb.2015.1.14) and Aphalo P. J. (2016)  (https://doi.org/10.19232/uv4pb.2016.1.15).

A book is under preparation, and the draft is currently available at (https://leanpub.com/r4photobiology/).

A handbook written before the suite was developed contains useful information on the quantification and manipulation of ultraviolet and visible radiation:
Aphalo, P. J., Albert, A., Björn, L. O., McLeod, A. R., Robson, T. M., & Rosenqvist, E. (Eds.) (2012) Beyond the Visible: A handbook of best practice in plant UV photobiology (1st ed., p. xxx + 174). Helsinki: University of Helsinki, Department of Biosciences, Division of Plant Biology. ISBN 978-952-10-8363-1 (PDF), 978-952-10-8362-4 (paperback).
