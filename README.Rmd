Package '**photobiologyLEDs**' complements other packages in the [_R for photobiology_ suite](https://www.r4photobiology.info/). It contains spectral emission data for diverse types of light emitting diodes (LEDs) and LED arrays (`leds.mspct`) available as electronic components. Spectra for LED-based lamps and other lamps are included in package ['photobioloyLamps'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiologyLamps/). Package 'photobiologyLEDs' also includes spectra from a COB LED when dimmed using the constant current approach (`COB_dimming.mspct`) and for a COB LED combined with reflectors with different beam angles (`COB_reflectors.mspct`).

This package contains only data. Data are stored as collections of spectra of class `source_mspct` from package 'photobiology', which is the core of the 
[_R for photobiology_ suite](https://www.r4photobiology.info/). Spectra can
be easily plotted with functions and methods from package ['ggspectra'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ggspectra/). The spectra can be used seamlessly with functions from package ['photobioloy'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiology/). However,
class `source_mspct` is derived from `list` and class `source_spct` is derived from `data.frame` making the data also usable as is with base R functions.
 
## Examples

```{r readme-01, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.asp = 2/3,
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "man/figures/README-"
)
```

```{r example-02, message=FALSE}
library(ggspectra)
library(photobiologyLEDs)
```

How many spectra are included in the current version of 'photobiologyLEDs'?

```{r example-03}
length(leds.mspct)
```

```{r example-03a}
length(COB_dimming.mspct)
```

```{r example-03d}
length(COB_reflectors.mspct)
```

What are the names of available spectra. We use `head()` to limit the output.

```{r example-04}
# list names of the first 10 LEDs
head(names(leds.mspct), 10)
```

To subset based on different criteria we can use predefined character vectors of LED names. For example, vector `nichia_leds` lists the names of the spectra for LEDs made by NIchia. 

```{r example-05}
Nichia_leds
```

We can use the vector to extract all these spectra as a collection.

```{r example-05a}
leds.mspct[Nichia_leds]
```

The package includes a character vector with the names of LED brands and LED colors as used for indexing vectors.

```{r example-05b}
led_colors
```

```{r example-05c}
led_brands
```

```{r example-05d}
led_uses
```

Vectors like `Nichia_leds` shown above are available for all the brands listed in `led_brands`, all the colors in `led_colors`, and all the uses in `led_uses`.

Summary calculations can be easily done with methods from package 'photobiology'. Here we calculate photon irradiance. As the spectra are normalised we pass `allow.scaled = TRUE`, 

```{r example-06}
q_irrad(leds.mspct[["Nichia_NS6L183AT_H1_sw"]], 
        allow.scaled = TRUE, scale.factor = 1e6)
```

The `autoplot()` methods from package 'ggspectra' can be used for plotting one or more spectra at a time.

```{r}
autoplot(leds.mspct[["Nichia_NS6L183AT_H1_sw"]]) + theme_bw()
```

The classes of the objects used to store the spectral data are derived from `"data.frame"` making direct use of the data with functions and methods from base R and various packages easy.

## Installation

Installation of the most recent stable version from CRAN:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("photobiologyLEDs")
```

Installation of the current unstable version from GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("aphalo/photobiologyLEDs")
```

## Documentation 

HTML documentation is available at (https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiologyLEDs/), including a _User Guide_.

News on updates to the different packages of the 'r4photobiology' suite are regularly posted at (https://www.r4photobiology.info/).

Two articles introduce the basic ideas behind the design of the suite and its use:
Aphalo P. J. (2015) (https://doi.org/10.19232/uv4pb.2015.1.14) and Aphalo P. J. (2016)  (https://doi.org/10.19232/uv4pb.2016.1.15).

A book is under preparation, and the draft is currently available at (https://leanpub.com/r4photobiology/).

A handbook written before the suite was developed contains useful information on the quantification and manipulation of ultraviolet and visible radiation:
Aphalo, P. J., Albert, A., Björn, L. O., McLeod, A. R., Robson, T. M., & Rosenqvist, E. (Eds.) (2012) Beyond the Visible: A handbook of best practice in plant UV photobiology (1st ed., p. xxx + 174). Helsinki: University of Helsinki, Department of Biosciences, Division of Plant Biology. ISBN 978-952-10-8363-1 (PDF), 978-952-10-8362-4 (paperback).
