#' Spectral data for LEDs array of unknown manufacturer
#'
#' Datasets containing the wavelengths and tabulated values spectral emittance
#' for different "generic" light emitting diodes (LEDs) without type
#' specifications. Bought from shops like Class Ohlson or hobby targete
#' electronic suppliers. Absolute values are not meaningful as the measuring
#' distances are variable, and in most cases unknown.
#'
#' The variables are as follows:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item w.length (nm)
#'   \item s.e.irrad (W m-2 nm-1)
#' }
