#' Spectral data for LEDs supplied by Agilent/Hewlett Packard
#' 
#' The collection of spectra \code{\link{leds.mspct}} contains spectra for 
#' some light emitting diodes (LEDs) from Agilent/Hewlett Packard (ca. 1995). 
#' Data are normalized to one at the wavelength of maximum emission. The
#' character vector \code{Agilent_leds} contains the names of the spectra to
#' facilitate their extraction from the collection.

#' The division of Hewlett Packard which supplied these LEDs became part of
#' Agilent when this division spin-off the mother company. More recently
#' the electronic components division of Agilent became Avago Technologies for
#' a while. Currently, BROADCOM supplies some of these LEDs or similar improved 
#' types.
