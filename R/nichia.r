#' Spectral data for LEDs from NICHIA
#' 
#' The collection of spectra \code{\link{leds.mspct}} contains spectra for 
#' some light emitting diodes (LEDs) from Nichia, Japan. 
#' Data are normalized to one at the wavelength of maximum emission. The
#' character vector \code{Nichia_leds} contains the names of the spectra to
#' facilitate their extraction from the collection.
#' 
#' @note Some of these LEDs were supplied by LUMITRONIX, Germany, assembled in
#' arrays of the series names SmartArray and LinearZ.
