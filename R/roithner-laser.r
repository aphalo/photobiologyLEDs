#' Spectral data for LEDs supplied by Roithner Laser
#'
#' The collection of spectra \code{\link{leds.mspct}} contains spectra for 
#' some light emitting diodes (LEDs) from Roithner LaserTechnik, Austria. 
#' Data are normalized to one at the wavelength of maximum emission. The
#' character vector \code{Roithner_leds} contains the names of the spectra to
#' facilitate their extraction from the collection.

#' @note
#' Roithner LaserTechnik is a distributor and reseller of LEDs, LED arrays and
#' lasers. They have a very extensive catalogue covering almost all wavelengths
#' for which LEDs are manufactured. Many of the LEDs are sold under new codes
#' as they are retested and in some cases individual characterization data
#' provided. For example some of short UV LEDs sold are from SETi.
